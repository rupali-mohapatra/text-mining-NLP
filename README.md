# text-mining-NLP
This task is based on a Kaggle competition launched a few years back to tribute to Star Wars day on the 4th of May.
Here, I will perform text mining and explain insights about the Star Wars movies scripts.
Tasks performed:
1.Find the characters with the most dialogues in each episode of The OriginalTrilogy (Episodes IV, V, VI).
2.Plot the number of dialogues according to the character for each episode (i.e.plot the above findings).
3.Add a new column “episode” to the three datasets (to distinguish between the threeepisodes) and concatenate them into one dataset.
4.Discover the frequency distribution of words in The Original Trilogy.
5.Create a Frequency Distribution plot of the most repeated words in The OriginalTrilogy.
6.Perform text-mining operations to prepare your dataset for further text analysis. (Usethe NLTK library)
a.Convert to lower case, word tokenization, removing stopwords, lexiconnormalization (lemmatization), etc.
b.Add the resulting array list to the dataset as a new column, “new_script”.
7.Repeat steps 4 & 5 but check the frequency distribution of the “new_script” this time.
8.Use Word Clouds to visually represent the most repeated words for Darth Vader andYoda. (Use the provided word cloud masks, make a single word cloud for eachcharacter.)
9.Discover the most relevant words in The Original Trilogy script. The TF-IDF model containsinformation on the more important and less important words (relevance).
10.Perform sentiment analysis on the movie scripts.
